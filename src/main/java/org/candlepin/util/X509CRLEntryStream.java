/**
 * Reads an X509 CRL in a stream and returns the serial number for a revoked certificate
 * with each call to the iterator's next() function.
 *
 * The schema for an X509 CRL is described in
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5">section 5 of RFC 5280</a>
 *
 * It is reproduced here for quick reference

 *      tbsCertList          TBSCertList,

 *                                }
 *
 * Version, Time, CertificateSerialNumber, and Extensions
 * are all defined in the ASN.1 in Section 4.1
 *
 * AlgorithmIdentifier is defined in Section 4.1.1.2
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * ASN1 is based around the TLV (tag, length, value) concept.  Any piece of
 * data begins with a tag defining the data type, has a series of bytes to
 * indicate the data length, and then the data itself.
 *
 * <b>This class does not perform any signature checking</b>.  Checking the signature is
 * theoretically possible but we would be unable to check it until after the list of
 * entries had been exhausted (since each entry would have to be sent through the hasher).  At
 * that point, the user already has all the serial numbers.  The best approach would perhaps
 * be to check the signature in hasNext() once revokedSeqBytes hits zero and throw a
 * RuntimeException.  We would also need a RSA public key as a parameter to the constructor.
 *
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690 and http://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html
 * for reference on ASN1 and DER encoding.
